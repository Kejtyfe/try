This part will show you the basic info and commands in BASH

When you open your BASH (Ubuntu), you will see a dollar sign with your repository $ 

Exmple
```bash
(base) kejty12:~$
```
Never type the $ into your code (it is there so you know you can interact with the BASH).

When you type your code, you execute it by pressing ⏎ Enter.

The 💲 is followed by a cursor -> you can move your cursor at the beginning of your line -> 
CTRL+A or at the End -> CTRL+E
